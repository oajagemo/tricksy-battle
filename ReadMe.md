What it does
- The cards are shuffled randomly.
- Each card in hand is printed out to the screen and corresonads to number a user can input
- You and the computer get 8 cards that are shuffled
- This game is only you vs the computer not player vs player. The computer doesnt know the humans hand
- One person plays a card (this is called “leading”).
- The other player has to play the same suit if they can. the code allows it 
- The highest card in the lead suit wins the round and gets 1 point. We add that to the score 
- Whoever wins the round goes first next round.
- Game ends when all cards are played.

- if player picked invalid/wrong choice - the code tells the human (You) to pick another choice until you pick a valid option 
- tells player to follow lead suit - but does not show lead suit which I understand can be confusing

What it does not do
- Humans always go first so the first player is not random 
- Game just plays the 8 in hand then ends - not reload after 4 cards 
- does not show one card from the deck 
- Game does not end early once a player gets to 9 points and the other has one
- The game does not have the shoot to the moon feature 
- computer just play first matching card
